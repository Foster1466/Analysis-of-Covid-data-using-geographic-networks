# Analysis-of-Covid-data-using-geographic-networks

# Abstract

Like all infectious diseases, Covid-19 transmission happens on a very local level. It does not just jump randomly around the world, it must pass from person to person, and these people will have to travel to a new place to spread the virus. Because of this reason, networks and network science have often been used to help model and analyse the spread of diseases, whether it is by using a social network to model the spread of the disease between people, or geographic networks to help us predict outbreaks based on what is going on in neighbouring places. We focused on geographic networks, where the nodes are places, and the edges link two places if they neighbour each other. Ultimately, we try and use such a network to create network features for one geographical area which can be used for many future possible applications.
